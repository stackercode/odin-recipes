			<li>5 large eggs</li>
			<li>3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups of all-purpose flour</li>
			<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cups whole milk</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		</ul>

		<h5>Icing:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (16 ounce) package brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 cup butter</li>
			<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
			<li><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup evaporated milk</li>
			<li>1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
		</ul>

		<h6>Steps</h6>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour
				three 9-inch cake pans.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make cake: Place white sugar and butter into a mixing bowl. Beat with an
				electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at
				a time, mixing well after each addition.
			</li>
			<li>
				Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Add flour
				mixture in batches, alternating with milk, beating batter briefly after
				each addition. Add vanilla extract; beat until batter makes ribbons when
				falling from the beaters. Divide batter among the prepared cake pans.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center
				comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
				Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a
				cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make icing: Combine brown sugar, butter, and salt in a saucepan over
				medium heat. Stir until brown sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add
				evaporated milk and continue stirring. Bring to a gentle boil and let
				bubble for about 4 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid sticking.
				Remove from heat and allow to cool, about 5 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mix confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract into brown sugar mixture
				using an electric mixer until icing caramelizes and thickens to the
				desired consistency.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spread icing onto cooled cake layers. Stack layers; ice top and sides.
			</li>
